        <h3>Class 01 | 03/27/2023 | Consuming a Movies API with Java.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Goal:</b> Get the title, poster and rating of the top 250 movies on IMDB. Since the IMDB API was showing instabilities, it was not possible to use the official API. Instead, alternative links offered by the immersion instructors were used.

        <h3>Class 02 | 03/28/2023 | Generating stickers for WhatsApp.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Objective:</b> Generate stickers for WhatsApp from images provided by the IMDB API. Once again, due to the instability of IMDB, the alternative links offered by the instructors were used. It was noticed that the stickers of some movies were not generated due to the presence of a colon (:) in the file name. To solve this problem, the colon (:) was replaced by a dash (-).
